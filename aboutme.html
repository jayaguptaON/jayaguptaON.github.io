                Hi! My name is Jaya Gupta. I'm a nanotechnology engineering student at the University of Waterloo. I'm interested in computer science and love learning to code. Below is some more about my education, interests & hobbies, and achievements.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
        <h2>Education</h2>
        <p><span style="padding-left: 2em">I</span>'m studying nanotechnology engineering, the manipulation of matter at the atomistic level to create innovations in various fields, including pharmaceuticals, electronics, and new materials, among others. I chose this field because it's a multi-disciplinary field that combines multiple areas I'm interested in, including electrical engineering, chemical engineering, materials science, physics, and biology.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
        <h2>Interests & Hobbies</h2>
        <h3>Coding</h3>
        <p><span style="padding-left: 2em">I</span>'m very interested in learning how to code because I like problem solving. Currently, I can code in Python, HTML/CSS/JavaScript, and MATLAB. I have learnt these languages both through school and on my own through hackathons and online resources. I'm currently working on further developing my skills in web development and machine learning/AI. I would also love to learn back end programming in the future.
        </p>

        <h3>Design</h3>
        <p><span style="padding-left: 2em">I</span> like learning about UX/UI design and incorporating design principles into my projects to make them more usable and aesthetically pleasing. I'm proficient in design tools such as UXPin, Figma, and Adobe XD.</p>

        <h3>Hackathons</h3>
        <p><span style="padding-left: 2em">I</span> enjoy attending hackathons because it gives me the opportunity to try solving real-world problems with tech. It's also a great way to develop my skills while meeting other students. My first hackathon was ECOding Hacks hosted by TOHacks at York University, where my team (pictured below) created a web-app called <strong>EnviroKids</strong> containing a suite of  games to educate kids about the environment. EnviroKids won the top prize in its category.</p>

        <p>Next, I attended WiC Hacks 2019 at the Rochester Institute of Technology. My team created <strong>MeeLia</strong>, a mental health voice assistant with sentiment analysis aimed at  helping women with mental health issues. MeeLia won the MLH Best Hardware Award. Most recently, I attended TechTogether 2019 in Boston. There, my team (pictured below) competed in the IBM challenge with an AI program called <strong>SmartHire</strong> in order to help eliminate AI bias in the hiring process. Our project won the IBM Research Award and the Liberty Mutual Best Hack for Gender Equality Award.</p>

        <h3>BioTEC Conference</h3>
        <p><span style="padding-left: 2em">I</span> help organize the University of Waterloo BioTEC Conference, an annual student-run biotechnology and bioengineering conference that strives to promote some of the most cutting edge developments at the intersection of biology and engineering. You can find more info about BioTEC <a href="https://www.uwbiotec.ca/" class="link" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

        <h3>Swimming</h3>
        <p><span style="padding-left: 2em">I</span>'m an avid swimmer and was on my high school's competitive swim team. I've also done lifeguard training through the National Lifesaving Society. </p>
